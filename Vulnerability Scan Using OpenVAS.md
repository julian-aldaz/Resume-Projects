# Resume Project: Vulnerability Scan of Metasploitable2 Using OpenVAS

### Setup:
1. Create a VM for Kali Linux to use OpenVAS
2. Create a VM for Metasploitable2
3. Configure VMs to be able to communicate with each other
4. Create a target in OpenVAS to scan Metasploitable2 and analyize results

### Overview:
Metasploitable2 was scanned using the full and fast configuration. The scan identified 68 vulnerabilites including 22 high, 40 medium, and 6 low severity findings based on CVSS ratings.

### Top 3 High Severity Vulnerabilites

TWiki XSS and Command Execution Vulnerabilites: CVSS score: 10.0, CVE-2008-5304. The scan detected outdate TWiki compentents that are vulnerable to cross-site scripting and command execution. This allows attackers to execute aribturay code through the %URLPARAM{}% and %SEARCH{}% variables which are not properly sanitized potentially causing the attackers to steal cookie-based authentication or comprmise the affected application.
