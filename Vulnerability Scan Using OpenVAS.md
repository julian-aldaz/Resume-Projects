# Resume Project: Vulnerability Scan of Metasploitable2 Using OpenVAS

### Setup:
1. Create a VM for Kali Linux to use OpenVAS
2. Create a VM for Metasploitable2
3. Configure VMs to be able to communicate with each other
4. Create a target in OpenVAS to scan Metasploitable2 and analyize results

---
### Overview:
Metasploitable2 was scanned using the full and fast configuration. The scan identified 68 vulnerabilites including 22 high, 40 medium, and 6 low severity findings based on CVSS ratings.

### 3 High Severity Vulnerabilites

1. TWiki XSS and Command Execution Vulnerabilities: CVSS score: 10.0, CVE-2008-5304. The scan detected outdate TWiki compentents that are vulnerable to cross-site scripting and command execution. This allows attackers to execute aribturay code through the %URLPARAM{}% and %SEARCH{}% variables which are not properly sanitized potentially causing the attackers to steal cookie-based authentication or comprmise the affected application. The solution is to upgrade to TWiki version 4.2.4 or later.

2. rlogin Passwordless Login: CVSS score: 10.0. The rlogin service was found to be active without requiring password authentication, enabling remote users root access without credientials allowing the attackers to have complete control over the system. As an outdated protocol it presents significant risk, the best solution would be to disable the rlogin service and use an alternative, secure protocol such as SSH.

3. Distributed Ruby (dRuby/DRb) Multiple RCE Vulnerabilities: CVSS score: 10.0. An improperly secured dRuby service was identified. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary Ruby code onto the target system which can lead to remote code execution with elevated privilages. To mitigate the risk the following should be applied: Implementing taint on untrusted input, setting $SAFE levels appropiately, and including drb/acl.rb to set ACLEntry to restrict access to trusted hosts.
