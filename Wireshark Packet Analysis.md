# Basic Network Packet Analysis Using Wireshark

### Setup:
1. Use Kali Linux in a VM to use Wireshark
2. Use Wireshark to analyze packets coming from this unsecure website: http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php
3. Utilizing sample TCP/HTTP data from the Google Professional Cybersecurity Certificate program to report findings.

### Overview: 
In the VM I started up Wireshark to start capturing data and entered the unsecure website, it was a login page in which I enter the username: admin, and the password: password123.
